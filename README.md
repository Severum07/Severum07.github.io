#### This is my family. I am the youngest of four siblings and this photo was taken during our celebration of my father's birthday in Naga although we reside in Sipocot.

### _Hobbies and Interests_

#### I find that I am not very unique but still, here are the activities that take up most of my time.

#### - Gaming (League of Legends, Valorant, Apex Legends)
#### - Watching Anime 
#### - Listening to Kpop (Twice, Nmixx, Itzy, StayC, Ive, Iz*One)
#### - Speedcubing 
#### - Drumming (Marching Snare)

#### I hope that these little bits of information can give you an idea about my personality. It is quite hard to make friends especially during this pandemic. I hope that this short portfolio can introduce myself for you. Thanks!
