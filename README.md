#### This is my family. I am the youngest of four siblings and this photo was taken during our celebration of my father's birthday in Naga although we reside in Sipocot.

### _Hobbies and Interests_

#### I find that I am not very unique but still, here are the activities that take up most of my time.

#### - Gaming (League of Legends, Valorant, Apex Legends)
